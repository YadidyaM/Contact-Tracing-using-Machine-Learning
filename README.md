# Contact Tracing with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a contact tracing system using machine learning algorithms to help identify potential contacts of individuals who may have been exposed to a contagious disease. The system analyzes various data sources to predict and track potential transmission paths.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Utilizes [insert machine learning framework/library] to develop predictive models.
  - [Brief description of the machine learning algorithms used].

- **Data Sources:**
  - Integrates data from [list of data sources, e.g., GPS data, Bluetooth, etc.].
  - [Explain how data is collected, processed, and stored].

- **Contact Identification:**
  - Predicts potential contacts based on [explain the features and criteria used].
  - Provides a confidence score for each identified contact.

- **Visualization:**
  - Visualizes contact tracing results using [insert visualization tools or libraries].
  - [Describe the visual representations, e.g., maps, graphs].

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
